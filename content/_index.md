Hey! ✌️

My name is Yannick. I'm a recent grad from the Department of Information
Technology and Electrical Engineering at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/),
where I focused on machine learning and secure, reliable systems.

I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [LatticeFlow](https://latticeflow.ai).
